<h1 align="center"> Centralised Grievance System Portal </h1>

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration -
We are trying to develop a web application that would be a sort of Centralised Public Grievance portal and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) but specifically dedicated to college(s).

It is an online platform available for the students 24x7 to lodge their grievances to the college authorities on any subject related to service delivery.
